This is a project for the purposes of a course from my university. It's a hotel reservation/management system for a hotel that provides:

1) A well built UI for an easy and friendly user experience
1) A reservation system so that users can book the desired rooms, with the ability to pay in advance and to make cancellations
2) A monitoring mechanism that helps the hotel staff to oranigze the reservations
